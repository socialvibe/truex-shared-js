# AGENTS.md

Behavioral and workflow guidelines for AI coding agents (and humans) working in this repo. **Project facts** — setup, build, test, run, architecture — live in [README.md](README.md); this file is about *how we work*, so the two don't overlap.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 0. MCP Tools

- **Jira:** Atlassian MCP — project `PI` ("PRGM - Publisher Integration"). Read, create, and transition tickets (see §5, §7).
- **GitHub:** use the `gh` CLI for PRs and issues.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Session Start

At the start of every session, in order:

1. Read [README.md](README.md) for project facts, and `CLAUDE-LOCAL.md` if present (optional, git-ignored personal notes). Incorporate their key data into your working context.
2. Check the current branch (`git branch --show-current`):
   - **If on the default branch (`develop`)**:
     1. Fast-forward the local default branch to its origin counterpart (`git fetch origin && git pull --ff-only`). Never branch from a stale default branch — it produces avoidable PR conflicts.
     2. Ask for the ticket number using `AskUserQuestion` with "Type Ticket Number" as the first option (follow up asking the user to type it if selected) and "Use NONE-001" as the second.
     3. Ask for a feature branch name the same way, create it, and switch to it before doing any work.
   - **If on a feature branch**: derive the ticket from the branch name (e.g. `feature/PI-3333/fix-something` → `PI-3333`, other possible prefixes: `ADX-XXXX`). Confirm it with the user in a single line of text.
3. Store the ticket for the rest of the session — reuse it for CHANGELOG entries, branch naming, commit messages, and PR titles without asking again.
4. **Commit messages** use `<TICKET> - <MESSAGE>` (e.g. `PI-3670 - Restructure ad tags catalog`). See [README.md](README.md) § Commits.

## 6. CHANGELOG.md & versioning

**Every PR bumps the version once. All notes for that increment live under one heading.**

Never commit directly to `develop` (company branch protection). Increment `package.json` in the PR (patch by default; minor/major when the change warrants it).

One PR can cover multiple related tickets (same context). Still one version bump. `CHANGELOG.md` needs **at least one entry per ticket**, not per commit.

1. Bump `version` in `package.json`.
2. Put CHANGELOG bullets under a single `## vX.Y.Z` heading that matches that version.
   - If the heading already exists, append there.
   - Do not add a second heading for the same increment.
   - Do not leave the new version without a heading.

Format:

```
## v<version>
* [<ticket>](https://infillion.atlassian.net/browse/<ticket>): <short description>
  * <optional detail>
```

Notes:

- The ticket number **MUST** be a markdown link to the Jira ticket.
- Use the ticket from §5 for the primary/branch ticket. Additional tickets in the same PR each get their own top-level `*` bullet.
- Nested `*` lines are details under a ticket, not a substitute for a missing ticket.
- CI fails the PR if `package.json` was not incremented vs `develop`, or if `CHANGELOG.md` does not have exactly one matching `## vX.Y.Z` heading.
- After merge to `develop`, CI publishes, tags, and creates the GitHub release. See [README.md](README.md) § Versioning & Releases.

## 7. Pull Requests

If directly opening PRs on GitHub you **MUST**:

1. Use the ticket number and the change short description from the correct `CHANGELOG.md` entry as the pull request title in the same form as commits: `PI-3670 - <short description>`. **PR title must be under 80 characters** (company policy).
2. Use the pull request template at `.github/pull_request_template.md` as the PR description, filling it in using data from the change itself and the `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
3. After the PR is open, offer to open it in the browser using `gh pr view --web`.
4. **Never offer to merge a PR.** PRs must be merged via the GitHub web interface per company guidelines.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
